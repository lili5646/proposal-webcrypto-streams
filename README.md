# What is this?

This is the beginning of a proposal to define streaming support for Web Crypto. The
idea is to develop the ideas for a bit then submit those to the WICG for consideration
once the effort to kick off another round of Web Crypto related work is officially
chartered. We want to do this bit of work in open.
